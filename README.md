In this part of the lab we'll now be creating tickets in our system and working them to completion. So first off as an end-user we'll make our first ticket for the agents to view their properties.

<p>
Now after our user creates the ticket we'll login to our agent John to view the ticket and set the correct properties to the ticket. Since the ticket seems more serious than the user stated we're going to change the SLA plan to a higher severity level. We also assigned this issue to the Online banking team since this is a banking issue as well as, changing the help topic.

You can also assign the tickets to a specific person like when jane assigns it to herself in one of the above pictures. Now we can resolve the ticket as jane.
